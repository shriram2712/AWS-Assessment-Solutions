Create an Autoscaling group and configure launch configuration it with Amazon linux ami and userdata to deploy basic website. Configure autoscaling.

STEPS :

1. We begin by creating a launch configuration for our Auto-Scaling group
2. Click on the Launch Configuration tab under the EC2 services
3. Click on create new launch configuration and select the required AMI ( Amazon LInux AMI ami-035b3c7efe6d061d5)
4. Choose the instance type and then give a name for the launch config. Also  in the additional details part, enter the script for the website in the user data section

#!/bin/bash
yum update -y
yum install httpd mod_ssl
service httpd start
chkconfig httpd on
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
usermod -a -G apache ec2-user
chown -R ec2-user:apache /var/www
chmod 2775 /var/www
find /var/www -type d -exec chmod 2775 {} \;
find /var/www -type f -exec chmod 0664 {} \;
echo "<?php phpinfo(); ?>" > /var/www/html/phpinfo.php

5. Finish the launch configuration process by selecting the storage, the security grps and review them
6. NOw, we get an option asking us whether we want to create an Auto Scaling group, click yes
7. Alternatively, you can create an auto scaling group from the tab with the same name and choose the required launch configuration
8. Set the name of the group and choose the VPC and the subsequent subnet to launch the group
9. Next in configure the scaling policies, set the min and the max amount of instances.
10. Add tags for the groups as required
11. Review and complete the process
12. Now you can also add instances from the instances tab if they are in the same VPC by updating the value of MAX
